# Chatbot Frontend Overview

## Overview

This repository hosts the Vue.js components for a personal chatbot application, focusing on two main features: a login page for secure user authentication and an "Ask Me Page" for interactive conversations. The login page ensures that only authenticated users can access the chatbot, protecting the privacy of the interactions. Once logged in, users can navigate to the "Ask Me Page," where they can ask questions and receive personalized responses. The application leverages Axios for backend communication, enabling dynamic exchanges between the user and the chatbot based on the user's inputs and the chatbot's programmed knowledge of the user's personal, academic, and professional background. This setup creates a tailored chatting experience, inviting users to explore various aspects of the user's life story through a conversational interface.
